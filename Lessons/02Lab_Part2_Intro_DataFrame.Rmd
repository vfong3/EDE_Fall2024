## Data frame definition

A **data frame** is used for storing data tables. It a list a vector of equal length.

When we import data to R, data frame is the preferred way for storing the data because columns can have different modes (character, numeric, integer, logical, complex).

## Data frame built-in example

Let's look into a built-in data frame from package "datasets" - cars. The data give the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop.

```{r cars}
cars # returns "cars" dataframe
```

Note that it has 2 columns and 50 rows.

## Data frame columns

Suppose you want just the column speed. How would you access that data?

```{r}
cars$speed #returns "speed" column from "cars" dataframe
```

How would you store it on another object?

```{r}
car_speed <- cars$speed
car_speed #extracts "speed" column from "cars" dataframe as a separate object
```

## Transforming object in a data frame

Is the new object you create a data frame?

```{r}
#Option 1
class(car_speed)

#Option 2
is.data.frame(car_speed)
```

How could you make it a data frame?

```{r}
df_car_speed <- as.data.frame(car_speed) # changes vector to dataframe
df_car_speed 
class(df_car_speed) # verifies class of dataframe
```

## Adding columns to a data frame

How could you add columns to *df_car_speed*?

```{r}
car_dist <- cars$dist

#Option 1
df <- cbind(df_car_speed,car_dist)  #similarly rows could be added using rbind()
class(df)
df

#Or Option 2 - transform into a data frame before binding
df_car_dist <- as.data.frame(car_dist)  #op2
df_opt2 <- cbind(df_car_speed,df_car_dist)
class(df_opt2)
df_opt2

```

Note that when we transformed the vector in a data frame the name of the vector became the column name.

```{r}
colnames(df)  #or simply names()
names(df)
```

## Creating a data frame

How would you create a data frame?

```{r}
#useful function data.frame()
create_df <- data.frame("speed"=car_speed,"dist"=car_dist)
create_df
```

## Data frame functions

Some useful functions to use with data frames.

```{r}
ncol(df)  #number of columns in df
nrow(df)  #number of rows in df
length(df)  #same as ncol in df
summary(df) #summarizes df
head(df) #show the first 6 rows of df

#If you know the number of the column you want you can refer to that to access column
df[,1]

#you could also use this notation to delete columns
df <- df[,-2]
df
```
